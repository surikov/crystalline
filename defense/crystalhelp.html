<p><em>Wiki: Tower defense (TD) is a subgenre of strategy video game where the goal is to defend a player's 
territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers, usually achieved by placing defensive structures 
on or along their path of attack.[1] This typically means building a variety of different structures that serve 
to automatically block, impede, attack or destroy enemies. Tower defense is seen as a subgenre of real-time strategy 
video games, due to its real-time origins,[2][3] though many modern tower defense games include aspects of turn-based 
strategy. Strategic choice and positioning of defensive elements is an essential strategy of the genre.</em></p>

<p >diamonds shoot at the balls and knock out the paint of their color. Balls consist of a paint of two or three colors, i.e. To destroy the entire wave, it is necessary to put at least two types of diamonds.
</p><p>
Balls change color depending on the number of remaining colors. After the ball is completely black (no colors), it is removed from the field.</p>

<p >Each type of diamond has an additional effect, which is sometimes added to a shot on the balls.</p>
<p >Red diamonds can &quot;burn&quot; ball. The burning ball is surrounded by a red light and receives a partial damage to the end of the effect:</p>

<p >Green diamonds can &quot; poison &quot; ball. During the effect of the effect, the ball gets slightly damaged and brakes all the balls following it:</p>

<p >The blue diamond can &quot; freeze &quot; ball. Frost completely stops the entire column of balls, but does not cause any damage.</p>

<p >Add diamonds of the right colors to each new wave of balls. Timely sell unnecessary colors and improve the existing diamonds.</p>
<p >If by the end of the path the balls become, for example, green - then you need to put more green diamonds.</p>
